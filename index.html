                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>Comics offer an interesting challenge to digital libraries and their integration into the latter has been a subject of both academic study and public practice for the past 20 years. Many libraries have focused on giving access to existing material, from around the world, and its bibliographic data to the public, while studies have focused on how semantic web technologies and standards can be used to facilitate the integration of the medium into the evolving concept of a digital library. Furthermore, in recent years the rise in popularity of machine learning approaches has also driven studies to look at how automation can further help and enhance this integration.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>For this project we decided to take a look at where comics stand with regards to semantic digital libraries and offer some assessments as well as a draft of a potential overall framework for thinking about a semantic digital library dedicated to this specific and popular literary medium.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Our approach is split into five parts:&nbsp;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>A brief look at definitions and state of the art in comics integration into digital libraries&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>A review of three existing resources, assessing their benefits and drawbacks</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>An outline of potential users</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>A basic framework for semantic digital libraries dedicated to comics that could be used as a starting point for either upgrading an existing library or creating a new one &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>An outline for a series of semantic improvements that the digital libraries we reviewed could implement to deal with comics&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>

                    <h1>A Note on Definition </h1>
                    <p>&ldquo;Defining comics entails cutting a Gordian-knotted enigma wrapped in a mystery&rdquo; - R. C. Harvey, 2001&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>In this project we attempt to deal with both comics as a medium, a way of communicating information that involves the combination of text and drawn images, and as a format, the ways in which this communication is physically (or now digitally) delivered to a user. Complicating things further are the connotations associated with the word &lsquo;comics&rsquo; itself, with the most important being its direct evocation of a US and British take on the medium popularized in the early parts of the 20th century and which has become synonymous with the word.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>As such, we&rsquo;ll use the word comics to broadly refer to the medium, regardless of its format, and when necessary we will refer to specific instances of formats. The three of us have an interest in and experiences with comics beyond their US/British connotations (Italian fumetti, French bandes dessin&eacute;e, and Japanese manga) as well as with both its physical and digital formats. To be a comics fan today means having an intrinsic understanding, if not outright knowledge, of the medium&rsquo;s historical and cultural versatility and the fluidity of its format.&nbsp;</p>

                        <h2>Background / State of the Art</h2>
                        <p>Due to their intrinsic combination of text and images, comics were long thought of as a non-serious literary format (though serious enough to warrant censorship) and were also deemphasised within the bibliographic world until the late 20th and early 21st century when histories and studies helped integrate the medium alongside other modern forms of multimedia information such as TV and the internet.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Today, many fields within the humanities - such as literary studies or library and information science - treat comics as a serious subject of study while GLAM institutions - including the Library of Congress and Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale de France - consider it a valid acquisition for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.loc.gov/rr/news/comics.html">preservation</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://bdnf.bnf.fr/EN/index.html">public engagement</a>.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>During the course of our research we came across various semantic-minded projects which we outline below and will be returning to for our improvement suggestions and framework.&nbsp;</p>

                        <h2>comics-focused corpora and databases</h2>
                        <p>A number of comics-focused corpora and databases currently exist, offering insight into the medium&rsquo;s various combinations of text and images as well as statistics about its creators, formats, and subjects.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>-<a href="https://groups.uni-paderborn.de/graphic-literature/gncorpus/corpus.php">&nbsp;Graphic Narrativity Corpus</a>&nbsp;<br>Produced by Hybrid Narrativity, a DH research project focused on graphic novels at the universities of Paderborn and Potsdam in Germany. The GNC was conceived as a monitor corpus, with regular updates, and currently contains around 240 titles, starting from the mid-1970s, of what the group defines as graphic narratives including &ldquo;fictional and non-fictional texts, such as graphic novels and memoirs, graphic journalism, and [...] graphic fantasy, including comic books.&rdquo; The project&rsquo;s website allows users to browse the corpus by authors and title as well as showcasing some statistical information via a series of basic visualisations.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>-<a href="https://www.visuallanguagelab.com/vlrc">&nbsp;Visual Language Research Corpus<br></a>Produced by Visual Language Lab, a research group devoted to linguistic and cognitive research on visual language and multimodality primarily based at Tilburg University. Where the GNC focuses on the text of comics, the VLRC is instead a corpus of annotated comics focused on enabling analysis of visual languages worldwide. It features over 36,000 panels from European, Asian, and American comics from 1940 to the present and its annotations include coding of panel frames, semantic relationships between panels, layout, and multimodality. The corpus is still in the process of being released to the public, expected sometime in 2022, and the group&rsquo;s research continues with the TINTIN project which seeks to analyse &ldquo;visual narratives as a window into language and cognition.&rdquo;</p>

While many of these datasets are describe as being public, in truth none of them are easily accessible to the public. Both DCM772 and edBDtheque were produced by academics at the University of La Rochelle in France, and require specific access request. The former includes 772 images taken from the Digital Comics Museum, an archive of public domain golden era comics which is assessed in this project, and annotations relating to bounding, character, and text recognition, while the later includes 100 pages from European, Japanese, and American comics with manual annotations and metadata for text lines, balloons, and panels.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>ICDAR2019FGC is a dataset extracted from DCM772, the result of an academic competition, and further focuses on fine-grained classification of characters.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>COMICS is the largest of the datasets, with over 1.2 million panels also extracted from the DCM archive, and annotated to enable narrative prediction based on a combination of text, images, and their bounding. It was created by academics at the University of Maryland, College Park and University of Colorado, Boulder.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Lastly, Manga109 is the only dataset we could find devoted exclusively to the Japanese version of the medium, produced by the Aizawa Yamasaki Matsui Laboratory, at the University of Tokyo. It includes 109 annotated manga volumes released between the 1970s and 2010s and intended for academic research or non-profit use (a subset is available for commercial use). Annotations include character faces and bodies, text, and frame. The project also includes a simple Python API to read annotation data while a dataset of onomatopoeias is currently under construction.&nbsp;</p>

The GCD is focused on cataloguing bibliographic data as it relates to comics, with images of covers the only non-textual asset within the database. As part of their cataloguing and preservation efforts, the GCD makes their database available as either a MySQL or name-value dump that uses a table-driven schema. The GCD is also one of the three resources which we assess in this project.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>The CaDNA is an ongoing project started in 2018 that &ldquo;examines library catalog data to explore geographies of publishing and library collecting policies in North American comics.&rdquo; The project draws from Michigan State University Library (MSUL) Comic Art Collection and has been driven by the university&rsquo;s Graphic Possibilities Research Workshop, which has used edit-a-thons as a means to explore and expand the original MARC data. This data has been released publicly via&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ktopham/comics-as-data">github</a>, and has been used to create&nbsp;<a href="https://graphicpossibilities.hcommons.org/comics-as-data-north-america-cadna/">vizualisations</a>. &nbsp;</p>

                        <h2>Ontologies</h2>
                        <p>In addition to databases and corpora, a number of Semantic Web efforts - primarily ontologies and markup languages - have contributed to the growth of academic research in the field as well as its integration into Linked Open Data and modelling efforts.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Ontologies:</p>
                        <p>-<a href="https://sean.petiya.com/thesis/">&nbsp;Comic Book Ontology</a> (CBO)&nbsp;<br>Created by Sean Petiya as part of his 2014 thesis at Kent State University, CBO is the first publicly available RDFS/OWL vocabulary dedicated to describing comics both in narrative and physical form. Petiya hopes that its conceptualization of the medium would allow it to be used to describe a variety of comics formats while also allowing &ldquo;for further describing other aspects of comics culture and scholarship, or connecting, community created data to Semantic Web applications, such as next-generation library catalogs.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>-<a href="https://schema.org/ComicSeries">&nbsp;Schema.org&apos;s ComicSeries type<br></a>In 2014, Schema.org added the ComicSeries type and related properties, placed under its Periodical type, which allows for the integration of comics related information into the wider Linked Open Data world. Marvel, one of the largest and best known comics publishers in the world, was part of the groups that pushed for the addition of the CosmicSeries type and while they do not accurately detail the origins of their own&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/entity_types">schema</a> (used in the API) it appears to use ComicSeries in some way.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>-<a href="https://dcpapers.dublincore.org/pubs/article/download/979/952.pdf">&nbsp;Metadata Framework for Manga<br></a>Proposed in 2009 by academics at the university of Tsukuba, the Metadata Framework for Manga defines three key aspects of Japanese comics - bibliographic, structural, and intellectual entities - with digital as the primary format. The framework is built on top of the FRBR and TV-Anytime models, extending these to allow various descriptions of manga that are key to their actual usage such as translations and narrative structure.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>-<a href="http://www.r4isstatic.com/231">&nbsp;A Comics Ontology</a>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Proposed by Paul Rissen in the early 2010s, this ontology is another early attempt at creating a way to &nbsp;&ldquo;describe the form of comics, and their narrative content, rather than the bibliographical information.&rdquo; It is cited by the eBDtheque creators as an inspiration for their own custom vocabulary used in their project. </p>

The Comic Book Markup Language, Advanced Comic Book Format, CoMet and ComicsML are the most notable, and commonly referenced, efforts. They all began in the early 2010s and take various approaches to extending XML for the purposes of representing document structure, visual sequences, textual features, descriptive information, and metadata.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The difference in approaches also includes how XML is extended: CBML is based on TEI; ComicsML is available as a Document Type Definition; ACBF and CoMet are both XML Schema Definition, with the former extensively detailed while the latter is more narrow and makes use of the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Yet in our research we&rsquo;ve only found one example of a non-commercial, public-funded app that combines cultural heritage and digital humanities: BnF&rsquo;s BDnF: The Comics Factory, which lets users create digital comics using the library&rsquo;s collections.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Alongside this there are a small number of APIs that deal with comics data including the aforementioned Marvel API, which grants access to information about the company&rsquo;s publications; the Comic Vine API, giving access to data from Gamespot&rsquo;s comic book wiki for non-commercial use; and Metron, a community-driven effort intended as a counterpoint to Comic Vine&rsquo;s corporate standing which is building an open database with REST API for comics and makes use of bibliographic data from the GCD.&nbsp;</p>
