                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>Comics offer an interesting challenge to digital libraries and their integration into the latter has been a subject of both academic study and public practice for the past 20 years. Many libraries have focused on giving access to existing material, from around the world, and its bibliographic data to the public, while studies have focused on how semantic web technologies and standards can be used to facilitate the integration of the medium into the evolving concept of a digital library. Furthermore, in recent years the rise in popularity of machine learning approaches has also driven studies to look at how automation can further help and enhance this integration.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>For this project we decided to take a look at where comics stand with regards to semantic digital libraries and offer some assessments as well as a draft of a potential overall framework for thinking about a semantic digital library dedicated to this specific and popular literary medium.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Our approach is split into five parts:&nbsp;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>A brief look at definitions and state of the art in comics integration into digital libraries&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>A review of three existing resources, assessing their benefits and drawbacks</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>An outline of potential users</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>A basic framework for semantic digital libraries dedicated to comics that could be used as a starting point for either upgrading an existing library or creating a new one &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>An outline for a series of semantic improvements that the digital libraries we reviewed could implement to deal with comics&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h1>A Note on Definition </h1>
                    <p>&ldquo;Defining comics entails cutting a Gordian-knotted enigma wrapped in a mystery&rdquo; - R. C. Harvey, 2001&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>In this project we attempt to deal with both comics as a medium, a way of communicating information that involves the combination of text and drawn images, and as a format, the ways in which this communication is physically (or now digitally) delivered to a user. Complicating things further are the connotations associated with the word &lsquo;comics&rsquo; itself, with the most important being its direct evocation of a US and British take on the medium popularized in the early parts of the 20th century and which has become synonymous with the word.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>As such, we&rsquo;ll use the word comics to broadly refer to the medium, regardless of its format, and when necessary we will refer to specific instances of formats. The three of us have an interest in and experiences with comics beyond their US/British connotations (Italian fumetti, French bandes dessin&eacute;e, and Japanese manga) as well as with both its physical and digital formats. To be a comics fan today means having an intrinsic understanding, if not outright knowledge, of the medium&rsquo;s historical and cultural versatility and the fluidity of its format.&nbsp;</p>
