                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Comics offer an interesting challenge to libraries. Traditional integration has focused on enabling public access to existing material and its bibliographic data, while semantic web technologies and standards, alongside machine learning approaches, have been used to explore how the medium can fit into the evolving concept, and reality, of a digital library.</p>
                    <p>In this project, we sketch out a potential framework for what a semantic digital library dedicated to this popular literary medium might look like. </p>
                    <p>Our approach is split into five parts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Definitions and state of the art in comics integration for digital libraries</li>
                        <li>Review of three existing resources</li>
                        <li>Outline of potential users</li>
                        <li>Framework for creating or updating semantic digital libraries dedicated to comics</li>
                        <li>Example implementation of framework using reviewed resources</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>A note on Definition</h2>
                    <p>“Defining comics entails cutting a Gordian-knotted enigma wrapped in a mystery” - R. C. Harvey, 2001 </p>
                    <p>This project deals with comics as a medium, a way of communicating information that involves the combination of text and drawn images, and as a format, the ways in which this communication is physically or digitally delivered to a user. Complicating things further are the connotations associated with the word ‘comics’ itself, the most important being its direct evocation of a US and British take on the medium popularized in the early parts of the 20th century and which has become synonymous with the word.</p> 
                    <p>We’ll use the word comics to broadly refer to the medium, regardless of its format, and when necessary we will refer to specific instances of formats. The three of us have an interest in and experiences with comics beyond their US/British connotations (Italian fumetti, French bandes dessinée, and Japanese manga) as well as with both its physical and digital formats. To be a comics fan today means having an intrinsic understanding, if not outright knowledge, of the medium’s historical and cultural versatility and the fluidity of its format.</p>

                    <h2>Background & State of the Art</h2>
                    <p>Following their beginnings in the first half of the 19th century as social satire, comics were long thought as a non-serious literary format due in part to their intrinsic combination of texts and images. Their continuous popularity throughout the 20th century in the United States, Europe, and Japan would ultimately change this perception.</p> 
                    <p>Today, many fields within the humanities - such as literary studies or library and information science - treat comics as a serious subject of study while GLAM institutions - including the Library of Congress and Bibliothèque Nationale de France - consider it a valid acquisition for <a href="https://www.loc.gov/rr/news/comics.html" target="_blank">preservation</a> and investment for <a href="https://bdnf.bnf.fr/EN/index.html" target="_blank">public engagement</a>.</p>

                                <p>Produced by Hybrid Narrativity, a DH research project focused on graphic novels at the universities of Paderborn and Potsdam in Germany. The GNC was conceived as a monitor corpus, with regular updates, and currently contains around 240 titles, starting from the mid-1970s, of what the group defines as graphic narratives including “fictional and non-fictional texts, such as graphic novels and memoirs, graphic journalism, and [...] graphic fantasy, including comic books.” The project’s website allows users to browse the corpus by authors and title as well as showcasing some statistical information via a series of basic visualisations. </p>
                                <h3><a href="https://www.visuallanguagelab.com/vlrc" target="_blank">Visual Language Research Corpus</a></h3>
                                <p>Produced by Visual Language Lab, a research group devoted to linguistic and cognitive research on visual language and multimodality primarily based at Tilburg University. Where the GNC focuses on the text of comics, the VLRC is instead a corpus of annotated comics focused on enabling analysis of visual languages worldwide. It features over 36,000 panels from European, Asian, and American comics from 1940 to the present and its annotations include coding of panel frames, semantic relationships between panels, layout, and multimodality. The corpus is still in the process of being released to the public, expected sometime in 2022, and the group’s research continues with the TINTIN project which seeks to analyse “visual narratives as a window into language and cognition.”</p>

                                <p>Datasets of annotated comic pages appear to be few and far between, and are all the direct product of academic research and in particular research into machine learning and automation of tasks such as character recognition, object metadata, image indexing, and multimodality. While many of these datasets are describe as being public, in truth none of them are easily accessible to the public.</p>
                                <p>Both DCM772 and edBDtheque were produced by academics at the University of La Rochelle in France, and require specific access request. The former includes 772 images taken from the Digital Comics Museum, an archive of public domain golden era comics which is assessed in this project, and annotations relating to bounding, character, and text recognition, while the later includes 100 pages from European, Japanese, and American comics with manual annotations and metadata for text lines, balloons, and panels. </p>
                                <p>ICDAR2019FGC is a dataset extracted from DCM772, the result of an academic competition, and further focuses on fine-grained classification of characters. </p>
                                <p>COMICS is the largest of the datasets, with over 1.2 million panels also extracted from the DCM archive, and annotated to enable narrative prediction based on a combination of text, images, and their bounding. It was created by academics at the University of Maryland, College Park and University of Colorado, Boulder.</p> 
                                <p>Lastly, Manga109 is the only dataset we could find devoted exclusively to the Japanese version of the medium, produced by the Aizawa Yamasaki Matsui Laboratory, at the University of Tokyo. It includes 109 annotated manga volumes released between the 1970s and 2010s and intended for academic research or non-profit use (a subset is available for commercial use). Annotations include character faces and bodies, text, and frame. The project also includes a simple Python API to read annotation data while a dataset of onomatopoeias is currently under construction.</p>

The GCD is focused on cataloguing comics bibliographic data, with images of covers the only non-textual asset within the database. As part of their cataloguing and preservation efforts, the GCD makes their database available as either a MySQL or name-value dump that uses a table-driven schema.</p>

This data has been released publicly via github, and has been used to create vizualisations.</p>

                                <p>Created by Sean Petiya as part of his 2014 thesis at Kent State University, CBO is the first publicly available RDFS/OWL vocabulary dedicated to describing comics both in narrative and physical form. Petiya hopes that its conceptualization of the medium would allow it to be used to describe a variety of comics formats while also allowing “for further describing other aspects of comics culture and scholarship, or connecting, community created data to Semantic Web applications, such as next-generation library catalogs.”</p>

                                <p>In 2014, Schema.org added the ComicSeries type and related properties, placed under its Periodical type, which allows for the integration of comics related information into the wider Linked Open Data world. Marvel, one of the largest and best known comics publishers in the world, was part of the groups that pushed for the addition of the CosmicSeries type and while they do not accurately detail the origins of their own schema (used in the API) it appears to use ComicSeries in some way. </p>

                                <p>Proposed in 2009 by academics at the university of Tsukuba, the Metadata Framework for Manga defines three key aspects of Japanese comics - bibliographic, structural, and intellectual entities - with digital as the primary format. The framework is built on top of the FRBR and TV-Anytime models, extending these to allow various descriptions of manga that are key to their actual usage such as translations and narrative structure. </p>

                                <p>Proposed by Paul Rissen in the early 2010s, this ontology is another early attempt at creating a way to  “describe the form of comics, and their narrative content, rather than the bibliographical information.” It is cited by the eBDtheque creators as an inspiration for their own custom vocabulary used in their project.</p>

                <p>XML schemas are an obvious tool to help describe, model, and integrate comics - especially digital ones - into the open web, libraries, and archives. The Comic Book Markup Language, Advanced Comic Book Format, CoMet and ComicsML are the most notable, and commonly referenced, efforts. They all began in the early 2010s and take various approaches to extending XML for the purposes of representing document structure, visual sequences, textual features, descriptive information, and metadata.</p> 
                <p>The difference in approaches also includes how XML is extended: CBML is based on TEI; ComicsML is available as a Document Type Definition; ACBF and CoMet are both XML Schema Definition, with the former extensively detailed while the latter is more narrow and makes use of the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set. </p>

                            <p>Following their beginnings in the first half of the 19th century as social satire, comics were long thought as a non-serious literary format due in part to their intrinsic combination of texts and images. Their continuous popularity throughout the 20th century in the United States, Europe, and Japan would ultimately change this perception.</p> 
                            <p>Today, many fields within the humanities - such as literary studies or library and information science - treat comics as a serious subject of study while GLAM institutions - including the Library of Congress and Bibliothèque Nationale de France - consider it a valid acquisition for <a href="https://www.loc.gov/rr/news/comics.html" target="_blank">preservation</a> and investment for <a href="https://bdnf.bnf.fr/EN/index.html" target="_blank">public engagement</a>.</p>
                            <p>Scroll left for an overview of existing research and projects dealing with comics and semantic digital technologies.</p>

                                        <p>Produced by Hybrid Narrativity, a DH research project focused on graphic novels at the universities of Paderborn and Potsdam in Germany. The GNC was conceived as a monitor corpus, with regular updates, and currently contains around 240 titles, starting from the mid-1970s, of what the group defines as graphic narratives including “fictional and non-fictional texts, such as graphic novels and memoirs, graphic journalism, and [...] graphic fantasy, including comic books.” The project’s website allows users to browse the corpus by authors and title as well as showcasing some statistical information via a series of basic visualisations. </p>

                                        <p>Produced by Visual Language Lab, a research group devoted to linguistic and cognitive research on visual language and multimodality primarily based at Tilburg University. Where the GNC focuses on the text of comics, the VLRC is instead a corpus of annotated comics focused on enabling analysis of visual languages worldwide. It features over 36,000 panels from European, Asian, and American comics from 1940 to the present and its annotations include coding of panel frames, semantic relationships between panels, layout, and multimodality. The corpus is still in the process of being released to the public, expected sometime in 2022, and the group’s research continues with the TINTIN project which seeks to analyse “visual narratives as a window into language and cognition.”</p>

                                        <p>Datasets of annotated comic pages appear to be few and far between, and are all the direct product of academic research and in particular research into machine learning and automation of tasks such as character recognition, object metadata, image indexing, and multimodality. While many of these datasets are describe as being public, in truth none of them are easily accessible to the public.</p>
                                        <p>Both DCM772 and edBDtheque were produced by academics at the University of La Rochelle in France, and require specific access request. The former includes 772 images taken from the Digital Comics Museum, an archive of public domain golden era comics which is assessed in this project, and annotations relating to bounding, character, and text recognition, while the later includes 100 pages from European, Japanese, and American comics with manual annotations and metadata for text lines, balloons, and panels. </p>
                                        <p>ICDAR2019FGC is a dataset extracted from DCM772, the result of an academic competition, and further focuses on fine-grained classification of characters. </p>
                                        <p>COMICS is the largest of the datasets, with over 1.2 million panels also extracted from the DCM archive, and annotated to enable narrative prediction based on a combination of text, images, and their bounding. It was created by academics at the University of Maryland, College Park and University of Colorado, Boulder.</p> 
                                        <p>Lastly, Manga109 is the only dataset we could find devoted exclusively to the Japanese version of the medium, produced by the Aizawa Yamasaki Matsui Laboratory, at the University of Tokyo. It includes 109 annotated manga volumes released between the 1970s and 2010s and intended for academic research or non-profit use (a subset is available for commercial use). Annotations include character faces and bodies, text, and frame. The project also includes a simple Python API to read annotation data while a dataset of onomatopoeias is currently under construction.</p>

The GCD is focused on cataloguing comics bibliographic data, with images of covers the only non-textual asset within the database. As part of their cataloguing and preservation efforts, the GCD makes their database available as either a MySQL or name-value dump that uses a table-driven schema.</p>

                                        <p>The CaDNA is an ongoing project started in 2018 that “examines library catalog data to explore geographies of publishing and library collecting policies in North American comics.” The project draws from Michigan State University Library (MSUL) Comic Art Collection and has been driven by the university’s Graphic Possibilities Research Workshop, which has used edit-a-thons as a means to explore and expand the original MARC data. This data has been released publicly via github, and has been used to create vizualisations.</p>

                                        <p>Created by Sean Petiya as part of his 2014 thesis at Kent State University, CBO is the first publicly available RDFS/OWL vocabulary dedicated to describing comics both in narrative and physical form. Petiya hopes that its conceptualization of the medium would allow it to be used to describe a variety of comics formats while also allowing “for further describing other aspects of comics culture and scholarship, or connecting, community created data to Semantic Web applications, such as next-generation library catalogs.”</p>

                                        <p>In 2014, Schema.org added the ComicSeries type and related properties, placed under its Periodical type, which allows for the integration of comics related information into the wider Linked Open Data world. Marvel, one of the largest and best known comics publishers in the world, was part of the groups that pushed for the addition of the CosmicSeries type and while they do not accurately detail the origins of their own schema (used in the API) it appears to use ComicSeries in some way. </p>

                                        <p>Proposed in 2009 by academics at the university of Tsukuba, the Metadata Framework for Manga defines three key aspects of Japanese comics - bibliographic, structural, and intellectual entities - with digital as the primary format. The framework is built on top of the FRBR and TV-Anytime models, extending these to allow various descriptions of manga that are key to their actual usage such as translations and narrative structure. </p>

                                        <p>Proposed by Paul Rissen in the early 2010s, this ontology is another early attempt at creating a way to  “describe the form of comics, and their narrative content, rather than the bibliographical information.” It is cited by the eBDtheque creators as an inspiration for their own custom vocabulary used in their project.</p>

                        <p>XML schemas are an obvious tool to help describe, model, and integrate comics - especially digital ones - into the open web, libraries, and archives. The Comic Book Markup Language, Advanced Comic Book Format, CoMet and ComicsML are the most notable, and commonly referenced, efforts. They all began in the early 2010s and take various approaches to extending XML for the purposes of representing document structure, visual sequences, textual features, descriptive information, and metadata.</p> 
                        <p>The difference in approaches also includes how XML is extended: CBML is based on TEI; ComicsML is available as a Document Type Definition; ACBF and CoMet are both XML Schema Definition, with the former extensively detailed while the latter is more narrow and makes use of the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set. </p>

                <p>&ldquo;Defining comics entails cutting a Gordian-knotted enigma wrapped in a mystery&rdquo; - R. C. Harvey, 2001&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In this project we attempt to deal with both comics as a medium, a way of communicating information that involves the combination of text and drawn images, and as a format, the ways in which this communication is physically (or now digitally) delivered to a user. Complicating things further are the connotations associated with the word &lsquo;comics&rsquo; itself, with the most important being its direct evocation of a US and British take on the medium popularized in the early parts of the 20th century and which has become synonymous with the word.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>As such, we&rsquo;ll use the word comics to broadly refer to the medium, regardless of its format, and when necessary we will refer to specific instances of formats. The three of us have an interest in and experiences with comics beyond their US/British connotations (Italian fumetti, French bandes dessin&eacute;e, and Japanese manga) as well as with both its physical and digital formats. To be a comics fan today means having an intrinsic understanding, if not outright knowledge, of the medium&rsquo;s historical and cultural versatility and the fluidity of its format.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>In this project we attempt to deal with both comics as a medium, a way of communicating information that involves the combination of text and drawn images, and as a format, the ways in which this communication is physically (or now digitally) delivered to a user. Complicating things further are the connotations associated with the word &lsquo;comics&rsquo; itself, with the most important being its direct evocation of a US and British take on the medium popularized in the early parts of the 20th century and which has become synonymous with the word.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>As such, we&rsquo;ll use the word comics to broadly refer to the medium, regardless of its format, and when necessary we will refer to specific instances of formats. The three of us have an interest in and experiences with comics beyond their US/British connotations (Italian fumetti, French bandes dessin&eacute;e, and Japanese manga) as well as with both its physical and digital formats. To be a comics fan today means having an intrinsic understanding, if not outright knowledge, of the medium&rsquo;s historical and cultural versatility and the fluidity of its format.&nbsp;</p>
